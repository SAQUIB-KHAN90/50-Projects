          >Harry Potter is a series of seven fantasy novels written by British
          author J. K. Rowling. The novels chronicle the lives of a young
          wizard, Harry Potter, and his friends, Hermione Granger and Ron
          Weasley, all of whom are students at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and
          Wizardry. The main story arc concerns Harry's conflict with Lord
          Voldemort, a dark wizard who intends to become immortal, overthrow the
          wizard governing body known as the Ministry of Magic, and subjugate
          all wizards and Muggles (non-magical people). The series was
          originally published in English by Bloomsbury in the United Kingdom
          and Scholastic Press in the United States. A series of many genres,
          including fantasy, drama, coming-of-age fiction, and the British
          school story (which includes elements of mystery, thriller, adventure,
          horror, and romance), the world of Harry Potter explores numerous
          themes and includes many cultural meanings and references.[1] Major
          themes in the series include prejudice, corruption, madness, and

          >The success of the books and films has allowed the Harry Potter
          franchise to expand with numerous derivative works, a travelling
          exhibition that premiered in Chicago in 2009, a studio tour in London
          that opened in 2012, a digital platform on which J. K. Rowling updates
          the series with new information and insight, and a trilogy of spin-off
          films premiering in November 2016 with Fantastic Beasts and Where to
          Find Them, among many other developments. Themed attractions,
          collectively known as The Wizarding World of Harry Potter, have been
          built at several Universal Destinations & Experiences amusement parks
          around the world.</p
